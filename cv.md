## **Summary**
By education I'm an economist. In my final year of university I got a job as an accountant in a private outsourcing organization. I had gained experience and grew into a chief accountant in a couple of years. But over time my work became boring, it was no longer enjoyable for me. Therefore I decided to change something in my life. I began to read about areas in programming: started studying basics Python, Quality Assurance, but my heart wasn't in it. And then I came across JavaScript courses at the Rolling Scopes School and it started...
  
In September 2022 I got a ceptificate of completion the Rolling Scopes School JS/FE Pre-school. Now I continue self-learning, going through the the next stage JavaScript/Front-end and I'm very passionate about this one. 
  
I'll do my best to become a proficient Front-end Developer.
